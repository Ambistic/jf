# jf

jf is a short package that provides many useful Python 
tools allowing to write high-level code efficiently.
Basically, it provides tools for diminishing cognitive 
load during scripting. jf is not intended to be used
in production code but for research use, as it is made 
for scientists and not for developers.


Basically, jf handles utils function to accelerate
and facilitate the setup of projects. It also handles
proper project architecture in a simple and flexible way.


## Projects


A project requires 3 things :
- code
- data
- output

That's why `jf` projects are always like this. 
To init a `jf` project, just create a "root.jf" file.
